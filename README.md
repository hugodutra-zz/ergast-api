### Ergast API
_____

For this project I used:
* React
* Redux
* Redux-saga
* Jest
* Enzyme
* Flowtype
* Create-react-app (for bootstraping)
* PureCSS for styling

I understand that the same result could be achieved using only React and components local state, but I wanted to have more freedom on the architeture.
